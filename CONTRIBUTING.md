First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug

- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Code Quality

### Frontend (Biome)

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting.

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm lint      # Check for issues
pnpm format    # Format code
```

### Backend (Ruff & Black)

We use `ruff` for linting and formatting (compatible with Black).

```bash
cd backend
ruff check .   # Check for lint errors
ruff format .  # Format code
```

## Pull Request Process

1.  Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
2.  Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
