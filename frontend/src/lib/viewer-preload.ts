/**
 * Asset-viewer progressive loading & neighbor preloading (pure, no React).
 *
 * Find exposes two resolutions per asset: a thumbnail and the original. The
 * viewer shows the thumbnail instantly (it's usually already cached from the
 * grid), then loads the original on demand — immediately for the active asset,
 * and lazily for neighbors so left/right navigation feels instant. This module
 * decides *which* asset URLs to preload given the current index and direction;
 * the component owns the actual <img> / Image() prefetching.
 *
 * Adapted from the AGPL-3.0 reference project's asset-viewer loading discipline
